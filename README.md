# Password Generator

## My Task

In this homework assignment I was asked to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. I was tasked to give it a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

I was also tasked to make it possible for the password to include special characters.
