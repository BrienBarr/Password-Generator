# Password Generator

## My Task

In this homework assignment I was asked to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. I was tasked to give it a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

I was also tasked to make it possible for the password to include special characters.

## User Request

```
The user, as an employee with access to sensitive data
wanted to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
so that he/she can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

I was asked to meet the following acceptance criteria:

1. If the user needs a new, secure password, when he/she clicks the button to generate a password,
he/she is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
1. When the user is prompted for password criteria, the user selects which criteria to include in the password.
1. When the user is prompted for the lenght of the password, the user chooses a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
1. When the user is prompted for character types to include in the password, the user can choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
1. When the user answers each prompt, the user's input is validated and at least one character type should be selected.
1. When the user is finished answering all prompts, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
1. When the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Mock-Up
